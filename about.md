I am a software engineer currently based in Dublin. On this blog, I will be sharing my thoughts on programming, particularly in its functional flavour, my experiences in using F# (or in time, other languages) and other stuff that should hopefully not stray too far from those topics.

I have used F# as a first language professionally since 2013, and for most of that time I have been an active member of StackOverflow F# community.

In my free time I enjoy watching Japanese movies.
